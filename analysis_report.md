# Sales Data Analysis Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a simple sales dataset using Python and pandas.  
The objective is to calculate key sales metrics, clean the data, and generate meaningful insights.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas library
- CSV data format

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following fields:
- **Order_ID**: Unique order identifier
- **Product**: Product name
- **Quantity**: Units sold
- **Price**: Price per unit
- **Total_Sales**: Revenue per order

The dataset includes missing values and duplicate records to demonstrate data cleaning techniques.

## Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed duplicate rows
- Filled missing quantity values with 1
- Recalculated missing total sales using Quantity × Price

---

## Key Metrics Calculated
1. **Total Revenue** – Sum of all sales
2. **Total Quantity Sold** – Overall units sold
3. **Best-Selling Product** – Product generating highest revenue
4. **Revenue by Product** – Grouped product-level revenue

---

## Insights
- Laptop generated the highest revenue among all products.
- Duplicate entries inflated initial counts and were removed.
- Handling missing values ensured accurate revenue calculations.

---

## Conclusion
The analysis successfully demonstrates data loading, cleaning, exploration, and reporting using pandas.  
This structured approach can be extended to larger real-world sales datasets.
